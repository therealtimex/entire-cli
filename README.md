# Entire CLI

Entire hooks into your git workflow to capture AI agent sessions on every push. Sessions are indexed alongside commits, creating a searchable record of how code was written in your repo.

With Entire, you can:

* **Understand why code changed** — see the full prompt/response transcript and files touched
* **Recover instantly** — rewind to a known-good checkpoint when an agent goes sideways and resume seamlessly
* **Keep Git history clean** — preserve agent context on a separate branch
* **Onboard faster** — show the path from prompt → change → commit
* **Maintain traceability** — support audit and compliance requirements when needed

## Requirements

- Git
- macOS or Linux (Windows via WSL)
- [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) or [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli) installed and authenticated

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install via Homebrew
brew tap entireio/tap
brew install entireio/tap/entire

# Or install via Go
go install github.com/entireio/cli/cmd/entire@latest

# Enable in your project
cd your-project && entire enable

# Check status
entire status
```

## Typical Workflow

### 1. Enable Entire in Your Repository

```
entire enable
```

This installs agent and git hooks to work with your AI agent (Claude Code or Gemini CLI). The hooks capture session data at specific points in your workflow. Your code commits stay clean—all session metadata is stored on a separate `entire/checkpoints/v1` branch.

**When checkpoints are created** depends on your chosen strategy (default is `manual-commit`):
- **Manual-commit**: Checkpoints are created when you or the agent make a git commit
- **Auto-commit**: Checkpoints are created after each agent response

### 2. Work with Your AI Agent

Just use Claude Code or Gemini CLI normally. Entire runs in the background, tracking your session:

```
entire status  # Check current session status anytime
```

### 3. Rewind to a Previous Checkpoint

If you want to undo some changes and go back to an earlier checkpoint:

```
entire rewind
```

This shows all available checkpoints in the current session. Select one to restore your code to that exact state.

### 4. Resume a Previous Session

To restore the latest checkpointed session metadata for a branch:

```
entire resume <branch>
```

Entire checks out the branch, restores the latest checkpointed session metadata (one or more sessions), and prints command(s) to continue.

### 5. Disable Entire (Optional)

```
entire disable
```

Removes the git hooks. Your code and commit history remain untouched.

## Key Concepts

### Sessions

A **session** represents a complete interaction with your AI agent, from start to finish. Each session captures all prompts, responses, files modified, and timestamps.

**Session ID format:** `YYYY-MM-DD-<UUID>` (e.g., `2026-01-08-abc123de-f456-7890-abcd-ef1234567890`)

Sessions are stored separately from your code commits on the `entire/checkpoints/v1` branch.

### Checkpoints

A **checkpoint** is a snapshot within a session that you can rewind to—a "save point" in your work.

**When checkpoints are created:**

- **Manual-commit strategy**: When you or the agent make a git commit
- **Auto-commit strategy**: After each agent response

**Checkpoint IDs** are 12-character hex strings (e.g., `a3b2c4d5e6f7`).

### How It Works

```
Your Branch                    entire/checkpoints/v1
     │                                  │
     ▼                                  │
[Base Commit]                           │
     │                                  │
     │  ┌─── Agent works ───┐           │
     │  │  Step 1           │           │
     │  │  Step 2           │           │ 
     │  │  Step 3           │           │
     │  └───────────────────┘           │
     │                                  │
     ▼                                  ▼
[Your Commit] ─────────────────► [Session Metadata]
     │                           (transcript, prompts,
     │                            files touched)
     ▼
```

Checkpoints are saved as you work. When you commit, session metadata is permanently stored on the `entire/checkpoints/v1` branch and linked to your commit.

### Strategies

Entire offers two strategies for capturing your work:

| Aspect              | Manual-Commit                            | Auto-Commit                                        |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Code commits        | None on your branch                      | Created automatically after each agent response    |
| Safe on main branch | Yes                                      | Use caution - creates commits on active branch     |
| Rewind              | Always possible, non-destructive         | Full rewind on feature branches; logs-only on main |
| Best for            | Most workflows - keeps git history clean | Teams wanting automatic code commits               |

### Git Worktrees

Entire works seamlessly with [git worktrees](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-worktree). Each worktree has independent session tracking, so you can run multiple AI sessions in different worktrees without conflicts.

### Concurrent Sessions

Multiple AI sessions can run on the same commit. If you start a second session while another has uncommitted work, Entire warns you and tracks them separately. Both sessions' checkpoints are preserved and can be rewound independently.

entire enable --strategy auto-commit

# Force reinstall hooks
entire enable --force

# Save settings locally (not committed to git)
entire enable --local
```

## Configuration

Entire uses two configuration files in the `.entire/` directory:

### settings.json (Project Settings)

Shared across the team, typically committed to git:

```json
{
  "strategy": "manual-commit",
  "agent": "claude-code",
  "enabled": true
}
```

### settings.local.json (Local Settings)

Personal overrides, gitignored by default:

```json
{
  "enabled": false,
  "log_level": "debug"
}
```

### Configuration Options

| Option                               | Values                           | Description                                          |
|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `enabled`                            | `true`, `false`                  | Enable/disable Entire                                |
| `log_level`                          | `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error` | Logging verbosity                                    |
| `strategy`                           | `manual-commit`, `auto-commit`   | Session capture strategy                             |
| `strategy_options.push_sessions`     | `true`, `false`                  | Auto-push `entire/checkpoints/v1` branch on git push |
| `strategy_options.summarize.enabled` | `true`, `false`                  | Auto-generate AI summaries at commit time            |
| `telemetry`                          | `true`, `false`                  | Send anonymous usage statistics to Posthog           |

### Auto-Summarization

When enabled, Entire automatically generates AI summaries for checkpoints at commit time. Summaries capture intent, outcome, learnings, friction points, and open items from the session.

```json
{
  "strategy_options": {
    "summarize": {
      "enabled": true
    }
  }
}
```

**Requirements:**
- Claude CLI must be installed and authenticated (`claude` command available in PATH)
- Summary generation is non-blocking: failures are logged but don't prevent commits

**Note:** Currently uses Claude CLI for summary generation. Other AI backends may be supported in future versions.

### Settings Priority

Local settings override project settings field-by-field. When you run `entire status`, it shows both project and local (effective) settings.

### Gemini CLI (Preview)

Gemini CLI support is currently in preview. Entire can work with [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli) as an alternative to Claude Code, or alongside it — you can have both agents' hooks enabled at the same time.

To enable:

```bash
entire enable --agent gemini
```

All commands (`rewind`, `status`, `doctor`, etc.) work the same regardless of which agent is configured.

If you run into any issues with Gemini CLI integration, please [open an issue](https://github.com/entireio/cli/issues).

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

| Issue                    | Solution                                                                                  |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| "Not a git repository"   | Navigate to a Git repository first                                                        |
| "Entire is disabled"     | Run `entire enable`                                                                       |
| "No rewind points found" | Work with Claude Code and commit (manual-commit) or wait for agent response (auto-commit) |
| "shadow branch conflict" | Run `entire reset --force`                                                                |

### SSH Authentication Errors

If you see an error like this when running `entire resume`:

```
Failed to fetch metadata: failed to fetch entire/checkpoints/v1 from origin: ssh: handshake failed: ssh: unable to authenticate, attempted methods [none publickey], no supported methods remain
```

This is a [known issue with go-git's SSH handling](https://github.com/go-git/go-git/issues/411). Fix it by adding GitHub's host keys to your known_hosts file:

```
ssh-keyscan -t rsa github.com >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts
ssh-keyscan -t ecdsa github.com >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts
```

### Debug Mode

```
# Via environment variable
ENTIRE_LOG_LEVEL=debug entire status

# Or via settings.local.json
{
  "log_level": "debug"
}
```

### Resetting State

```
# Reset shadow branch for current commit
entire reset --force

# Disable and re-enable
entire disable && entire enable --force
```

### Accessibility

For screen reader users, enable accessible mode:

```
export ACCESSIBLE=1
entire enable
```

This uses simpler text prompts instead of interactive TUI elements.
