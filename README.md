# Entire CLI

Entire hooks into your git workflow to capture AI agent sessions on every push. Sessions are indexed alongside commits, creating a searchable record of how code was written. Runs locally, stays in your repo.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install via Homebrew (requires SSH access)
brew tap entirehq/tap git@github.com:entirehq/homebrew-entire.git
brew install entirehq/tap/entire

# Enable in your project
cd your-project && entire enable

# Check status
entire status
```

## Typical Workflow

### 1. Enable Entire in Your Repository

```bash
entire enable
```

This installs Claude Code and git hooks that automatically capture checkpoints whenever Claude Code makes changes. Your code commits stay clean—all session metadata is stored separately.

### 2. Work with Claude Code

Just use Claude Code normally. Entire runs in the background, creating checkpoints automatically:

```bash
entire status  # Check current session status anytime
```

### 3. Rewind to a Previous Checkpoint

If you want to undo some changes and go back to an earlier checkpoint:

```bash
entire rewind
```

This shows all available checkpoints in the current session. Select one to restore your code to that exact state.

### 4. Resume a Previous Session

To see and restore sessions from earlier work:

```bash
entire resume
```

Lists all past sessions with timestamps. You can view the conversation history or restore the code from any session.

### 5. Disable Entire (Optional)

```bash
entire disable
```

Removes the git hooks. Your code and commit history remain untouched.

## Key Concepts

### Sessions

A **session** represents a complete interaction with your AI agent, from start to finish. Each session captures all prompts, responses, files modified, and timestamps.

**Session ID format:** `YYYY-MM-DD-<UUID>` (e.g., `2026-01-08-abc123de-f456-7890-abcd-ef1234567890`)

Sessions are stored separately from your code commits on the `entire/sessions` branch.

### Checkpoints

A **checkpoint** is a snapshot within a session that you can rewind to—a "save point" in your work.

**When checkpoints are created:**

- **Manual-commit strategy**: When you make a git commit
- **Auto-commit strategy**: After each agent response

**Checkpoint IDs** are 12-character hex strings (e.g., `a3b2c4d5e6f7`).

### Strategies

Entire offers two strategies for capturing your work:

| Aspect              | Manual-Commit                            | Auto-Commit                                        |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Code commits        | None on your branch                      | Created automatically after each agent response    |
| Safe on main branch | Yes                                      | No - creates commits                               |
| Rewind              | Always possible, non-destructive         | Full rewind on feature branches; logs-only on main |
| Best for            | Most workflows - keeps git history clean | Teams wanting automatic code commits               |

## Commands Reference

| Command          | Description                                                                   |

### `entire enable` Flags

| Flag                | Description                                                        |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `--strategy <name>` | Strategy to use: `manual-commit` (default) or `auto-commit`        |
| `--force`, `-f`     | Force reinstall hooks (removes existing Entire hooks first)        |
| `--local`           | Write settings to `settings.local.json` instead of `settings.json` |
| `--project`         | Write settings to `settings.json` even if it already exists        |
| `--telemetry=false` | Disable anonymous usage analytics                                  |

**Examples:**

```bash
# Use auto-commit strategy
entire enable --strategy auto-commit

# Force reinstall hooks
entire enable --force

# Save settings locally (not committed to git)
entire enable --local
```

## Configuration

Entire uses two configuration files in the `.entire/` directory:

### settings.json (Project Settings)

Shared across the team, typically committed to git:

```json
{
  "strategy": "manual-commit",
  "agent": "claude-code",
  "enabled": true
}
```

### settings.local.json (Local Settings)

Personal overrides, gitignored by default:

```json
{
  "enabled": false,
  "log_level": "debug"
}
```

### Configuration Options

| Option                                 | Values                           | Description                                    |
| -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `strategy`                             | `manual-commit`, `auto-commit`   | Session capture strategy                       |
| `enabled`                              | `true`, `false`                  | Enable/disable Entire                          |
| `agent`                                | `claude-code`, `gemini`, etc.    | AI agent to integrate with                     |
| `log_level`                            | `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error` | Logging verbosity                              |
| `strategy_options.push_sessions`       | `true`, `false`                  | Auto-push `entire/sessions` branch on git push |
| `strategy_options.summarize.enabled`   | `true`, `false`                  | Auto-generate AI summaries at commit time      |

### Auto-Summarization

When enabled, Entire automatically generates AI summaries for checkpoints at commit time. Summaries capture intent, outcome, learnings, friction points, and open items from the session.

```json
{
  "strategy_options": {
    "summarize": {
      "enabled": true
    }
  }
}
```

**Requirements:**
- Claude CLI must be installed and authenticated (`claude` command available in PATH)
- Summary generation is non-blocking: failures are logged but don't prevent commits

**Note:** Currently uses Claude CLI for summary generation. Other AI backends may be supported in future versions.

### Settings Priority

Local settings override project settings field-by-field. When you run `entire status`, it shows both project and local (effective) settings.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

| Issue                    | Solution                                                                                  |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "Not a git repository"   | Navigate to a git repository first                                                        |
| "Entire is disabled"     | Run `entire enable`                                                                       |
| "No rewind points found" | Work with Claude Code and commit (manual-commit) or wait for agent response (auto-commit) |
| "shadow branch conflict" | Run `entire reset --force`                                                                |
| "session not found"      | Check available sessions with `entire session list`                                       |

### SSH Authentication Errors

If you see an error like this when running `entire resume`:

```
Failed to fetch metadata: failed to fetch entire/sessions from origin: ssh: handshake failed: ssh: unable to authenticate, attempted methods [none publickey], no supported methods remain
```

This is a [known issue with go-git's SSH handling](https://github.com/go-git/go-git/issues/411). Fix it by adding GitHub's host keys to your known_hosts file:

```bash
ssh-keyscan -t rsa github.com > ~/.ssh/known_hosts
ssh-keyscan -t ecdsa github.com >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts
```

### Debug Mode

```bash
# Via environment variable
ENTIRE_LOG_LEVEL=debug entire status

# Or via settings.local.json
{
  "log_level": "debug"
}
```

### Resetting State

```bash
# Reset shadow branch for current commit
entire reset --force

# Disable and re-enable
entire disable && entire enable --force
```

### Accessibility

For screen reader users, enable accessible mode:

```bash
export ACCESSIBLE=1
entire enable
```

This uses simpler text prompts instead of interactive TUI elements.
